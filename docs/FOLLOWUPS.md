# Followups — known issues spotted but not yet acted on

Ad-hoc tracker for things found during code review that don't warrant
immediate action but shouldn't be lost. Each entry should name the task
or context where the finding arose, the disposition (deferred / planned /
accepted), and the trigger that should re-surface it.

When an entry is resolved, remove it from this file (git history retains it).

## SHORT_LINK_RE does not handle query parameters on short links

**Found in:** T5 code quality review.
**Disposition:** Deferred to Plan C.
**Trigger to revisit:** Plan C planning session, before short-link resolution lands.

The short-link regex in `src/canonical.rs` ends with `/?$`:

```
^https?://(?:vm\.tiktok\.com|vt\.tiktok\.com|(?:www\.)?tiktok\.com/t)/[A-Za-z0-9]+/?$
```

This means a tracking-parameterized short link such as
`https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMabcdef/?utm_source=share` falls through to
`Canonical::Invalid` rather than `Canonical::NeedsResolution`.

CANONICAL_RE handles `?` correctly via `(?:/|\?|$)`. The asymmetry is real.

**Plan A impact:** small. Plan A only logs short links and skips them; the
miscategorization just shifts a count from `short_links_skipped` to
`invalid_urls_skipped` in `IngestStats`. Both end up not transcribed.

**Plan C impact:** real. Plan C will pick up rows from `pending_resolutions`
for HEAD-redirect resolution. Query-stringed short links would never reach
that table → silent data loss for those URLs.

**Suggested fix (when Plan C lands):** change the SHORT_LINK_RE suffix to
something like `(?:/[A-Za-z0-9]*)?(?:\?.*)?$` (match optional trailing slash,
then optional query string). Add a coverage test for both forms.

If DDP exports turn out to commonly include `?utm_source=…` on shared short
links, consider promoting this to a fixed bug in Plan B's first iteration
rather than waiting for Plan C — depends on what the donation extraction
script actually emits.
